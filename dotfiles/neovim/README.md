# Neovim

This `README.md` will serve as the user manual for my Neovim config and workflow to help me familiarize and refine.

- Refine my search tools
    - I need two broad categories of search functionality: 1) fast low-overhead search, and 2) a heavyweight solution suitable for long and complex engagements of raw string searches.
    - I'm currently using *telescope* for my fast search needs, but it will need some performance tweaking. It freezes in massive codebases.
        - Apparently, I can configure it to use some other search tool? Maybe that'll solve the performance issues.
    - **I'll still need to find a heavyweight solution.**
    - Some tools I've been told to look into:
        - <https://github.com/google/codesearch/>
        - <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>
- How do I get Typescript LSP working? I want:
    - Types analysis.
    - Highlight problems.
    - Autocomplete.
    - (Maybe I need mason for this.)
