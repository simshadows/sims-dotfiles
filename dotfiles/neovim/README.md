# Neovim

This `README.md` will serve as the user manual for my Neovim config and workflow to help me familiarize and refine.

- Refine my search tools
    - I need two broad categories of search functionality: 1) fast low-overhead search, and 2) a heavyweight solution suitable for long and complex engagements of raw string searches.
    - I'm currently using *fzf-lua* for my fast search needs. Still evaluating how to use it.
    - **I'll still need to find a heavyweight solution.**
- How do I get Typescript LSP working? I want:
    - Types analysis.
    - Highlight problems.
    - Autocomplete.
    - (Maybe I need mason for this.)
