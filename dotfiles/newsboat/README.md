# Sim's Newsboat Files

## RSS Subscriptions

Check out `.newsboat/urls` for a full list of my RSS subscriptions.

## OPML Files

Subscriptions are also automatically exported to OPML format to `dotfiles/newsboat/autogenerated-opml/`. This is intended to be subscribed to on Github, allowing my [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) account to synchronize with my Newsboat RSS subscriptions.

Subscribe to them, by all means!

### What are each OPML file for?

Since OPML lacks tags, the subscriptions on the exported OPML file alone is difficult to structure. To solve this, I wrote a script that parses my `urls` file for tags and splits the exported OPML file.

- The `ORIGINAL.xml` is this original full OPML file.
- The `NO-TAGS.xml` contains subscriptions that lack a tag.
- All other `.xml` files are for each tag. Since subscriptions can have multiple tags, there can be overlap between these files.

These OPML files are autogenerated by running `autogen.sh` at the root of the repository.

**Another option is that I'd have to construct some elaborate title system and rely on the rules created within Inoreader to interpret my titles. I'll consider doing that in the future if this file-split system runs into problems.**
