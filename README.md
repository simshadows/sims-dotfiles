# Sim's Dotfiles

Dotfiles for Linux, with an included symlink script.

## Planned Content

Currently, I'm working on making this for Linux. Only later will I expand to OSX and other platforms, evolving the installation scripts and repository organization along the way to support these different use-cases.
